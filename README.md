# React prototype 

This project uses [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react) to create a simple form wizard/stepper for the widget. Nextjs has typescript support out of the box so I included all the types for the dependencies in the project and try to leverage them where appropriate. I used the [Ant Design components](https://ant.design/) for the grid and shit like that. 

## Installation
`npm install`

## Start Project 
`npm run dev`

### NOTES
I used nextjs to explore pre-rendering the widget for a simpler deployable asset and because it's a nice developer experience :)
